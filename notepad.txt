Scenario:
"""
    Process a product return and refund request:
    
    Order ID: ORD-1234567890
    Customer ID: CUST-12345
    Return Reason: defective
    Items to Return:
    - SKU: PROD-001, Quantity: 1 (defective - screen not working)
    
    Required Steps:
    1. Retrieve the existing order details by order ID
    2. Validate the order status (check if it can be returned)
    3. Check how many days have passed since delivery
    4. Validate the return is within the 30-day return window
    5. Evaluate the return reason:
       - If "defective": Full refund, no restocking fee, prepaid return label
       - If "changed_mind": Refund minus 15% restocking fee
       - If "wrong_item": Full refund, our mistake
    6. Calculate the refund amount:
       - Original item cost
       - Shipping refund (if defective)
       - Restocking fee (if applicable)
       - Tax refund
    7. Validate refund doesn't exceed original payment
    8. Process the refund to original payment method
    9. Generate a prepaid return shipping label
    10. Update inventory to reflect the return
    11. Send refund confirmation email with:
        - Refund amount and breakdown
        - Return shipping label
        - Expected refund arrival time
    12. Update customer account with return history
    
    Important: Since this is a defective item, ensure the customer receives 
    excellent service - full refund including shipping, prepaid return label, 
    and expedited processing.
